# UI Design

## Instructions

When creating frontend designs, avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Make creative, distinctive choices that surprise and delight users.

### Typography

1. Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
2. **Avoid**: Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts
3. **Avoid overused alternatives**: Space Grotesk (commonly chosen by AI)
4. Explore distinctive typefaces that elevate the design

### Color & Theme

1. Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
2. Use CSS variables for consistency
3. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes
4. Draw inspiration from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics
5. **Avoid**: Purple gradients on white backgrounds (clichéd)
6. Vary between light and dark themes across projects

### Motion & Animation

1. Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
2. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
3. Use Motion library for React when available
4. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (`animation-delay`) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions

### Backgrounds

1. Create atmosphere and depth
2. **Avoid**: Defaulting to solid colors
3. Layer CSS gradients
4. Use geometric patterns
5. Add contextual effects matching the overall aesthetic

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts, Space Grotesk)
- Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character
- Convergent choices across generations

## Best Practices

- Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices
- Design genuinely for the specific context
- Think outside the box with every project
- Vary aesthetics significantly between projects
- Let the content and purpose guide distinctive design decisions
