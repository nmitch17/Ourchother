    "Here are messages from the previous conversation: Bash(cd .claude/skills/dev-browser && bun x tsx <<'EOF'       timeout: 30s\n      import { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\u2026)\n  \u23bf  {                                                   \n       url: 'http://localhost:3002/project/test-project',\n       title: 'Ourchother | AI-Native Agency for Growth'\n     }\n\n\u23fa Now let me fill in the password to access the dashboard:\n\n\u23fa Bash(cd .claude/skills/dev-browser && bun x tsx <<'EOF'       timeout: 30s\n      import { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\u2026)\n  \u23bf  Error: PreToolUse:Bash hook error: [uv run .claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py]: error: Failed to spawn: `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py`\n       Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)\n\n\u23fa Bash(bun x tsx <<'EOF'                                        timeout: 30s\n      import { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\u2026)\n  \u23bf  Error: PreToolUse:Bash hook error: [uv run .claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py]: error: Failed to spawn: `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py`\n       Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)\n\n\u23fa There seems to be a hook issue. Let me use the chrome-devtools MCP instead to continue working:\n\n\u23fa chrome-devtools - navigate_page (MCP)(url: \"http://localhost:3002/project/test-project\", type: \"url\", timeout: 15000)\n  \u23bf  Error: PreToolUse:mcp__chrome-devtools__navigate_page hook error: [uv run .claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py]: error: Failed to spawn: `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py`\n       Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)\n\n\u23fa There's a hook issue. Looking at the screenshot you shared, I can see the problem - there's a nested main element causing the boxed layout. Let me fix the code directly:\n\n\u23fa Read(src/components/client/client-dashboard.tsx)\n  \u23bf  Error: PreToolUse:Read hook error: [uv run .claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py]: error: Failed to spawn: `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py`\n       Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)\n\n\u23fa The hooks are failing because the path is wrong.

    "Okay, we need to install this in the main user directory in this machine. Because absolute paths are going to break these when I'm when I'm changing these when I'm using reusing these between projects. So we need to have we can use absolute paths as long as they are at the root level of this machine. And then let's change we can remove the hooks folder from dot clod and just run them from the root level Claude directory.",
