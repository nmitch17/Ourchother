    "Let's change internal and external clients. We don't need this actually. Let's treat. I will create our each other as a client. That's me, that's us.

This is a false distinction that we need to make between internal and external.\n\nWhat's required in this? Break this down. As a plan, we need to figure out what the plan would be for this. I don't remember if we have separate tables for internal clients or external clients or anything like that. ",

    "Analyze the plan: ArchEtherDash tasks. No migrations have been run, so there are no tables that have been set up. There has been no tables, no row-level security, nothing done in Supabase. We need to create these tables, make sure that that's in the tab, and the tasks, and if not, put it in so that it's just done now. "
